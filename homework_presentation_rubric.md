## Homework presentations

To give you practice communicating about the topics in this course, and to reinforce the material we learn, you will be required to do **three** homework presentations throughout the semester. In a homework presentation, you will meet with me individually (outside of class time) for 15-20 minutes and present a problem from a recent homework assignment (I will choose the problem, so you must be prepared to present any of the questions on the assignment). For questions with many parts, I will choose some subset of the parts.

By "present a problem", I mean that you will work through the problem step by step on the board, beginning with the problem statement and ending with the final answer. Unlike in office hours, I will not provide input or guidance as you work through the problem. Your work will need to show and justify all necessary steps, and you will explain your work as you go. At the end, I may ask some follow-up questions about your solution.

You will be graded on your communication of the problem, your conceptual understanding of the material, the logic and correctness of your solution, your presentation skills, and your responses to my follow-up questions.

| Formulation of Problem           | Clearly states the question being asked, in both common language as well as precise mathematical notation                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                       | Rewrites the problem, but struggles to explain what the question is asking.                                                     | /1    |
| Conceptual Understanding         | Demonstrates understanding of core statistical concepts, defines all needed quantities, and accurately describes the process to solve the problem.              | Shows a solid understanding of basic statistical concepts, but struggles with more complex ideas or nuanced explanations.                                             | Responses are vague or contain some inaccuracies, suggesting a superficial understanding of concepts.                           | /1    |
| Application and Analysis         | Correctly applies the chosen statistical method, accurately interprets the results in the context of the problem, and identifies any limitations or assumptions | Applies the correct statistical method and provides a generally accurate interpretation of the results, though the analysis may lack depth or consideration of nuance | Performs some correct calculations, but may misinterpret the results. May fail to connect the findings to the problem's context | /1    |
| Presentation Skills              | Uses precise language, speaks clearly and directly, and writing shows a clear flow of ideas.                                                                    | Presentation is generally easy to follow, but may use some terminology or mathematical writing inconsistently or incorrectly                                          | Explanations are difficult to follow, and presentation shows disorganization.                                                   | /1    |
| Responses to Follow-up Questions | Answers challenging follow-up questions, providing additional insights                                                                                          | Answers most follow-up questions, though may need some prompting to elaborate.                                                                                        | Struggles to answer follow-up questions or requires significant prompting.                                                      | /1    |
