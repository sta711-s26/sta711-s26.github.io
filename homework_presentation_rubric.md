## Homework presentations

To give you practice communicating about the topics in this course, and to reinforce the material we learn, you will be required to do **three** homework presentations throughout the semester. In a homework presentation, you will meet with me individually (outside of class time) for 15-20 minutes and present a problem from a recent homework assignment (I will choose the problem, so you must be prepared to present any of the questions on the assignment). For questions with many parts, I will choose some subset of the parts.

By "present a problem", I mean that you will work through the problem step by step on the board, beginning with the problem statement and ending with the final answer. Unlike in office hours, I will not provide input or guidance as you work through the problem. Your work will need to show and justify all necessary steps, and you will explain your work as you go. At the end, I may ask some follow-up questions about your solution.

You will be graded on your communication of the problem, your conceptual understanding of the material, the logic and correctness of your solution, your presentation skills, and your responses to my follow-up questions.
